This is a WordPress starter theme aimed at front end developers. Basically all I've done is take Zurb's Foundations (3.2.2), and made it work as a WordPress theme. This is a serious work in progress, and currently does not have easy-to-use plug and play stuff.

Using Codekit with this is highly recommended. For the folks who don't have Codekit, I will be writing some usage stuff in the future.

## Features
* Concatenated javascript files (app-ck.js) that include everything in order.
* .sass for your css. Awesome!
* Everything that Foundation has to offer.

## Disclaimer
This is a work in progress, and not even a beta. Or an alpha. Do not use. For internal use only. (I'm just being cheap and won't pay git premium for private repos.)
